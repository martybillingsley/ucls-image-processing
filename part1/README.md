# Digital Image Processing
A picture is stored on the computer as a series of numbers -- numbers indicating variations of red, green, and blue at different locations on a grid of pixels. 

## Pixels
Take a picture and lay a grid of squares over it. Each of the squares is a pixel. To store the picture, the computer records a number to represent the color of each square (sort of like a digital color-by-number). The more squares in the grid, the better the image will look.

A *pixel* (short for *picture element*) is a tiny square of color. Lots of pixels together form an image.

## Colors
An RGB pixel is made of three numbers, each between 0 and 255. The numbers are always in this order: red, green, blue. They can be combined to make over 16 million colors. (digital color playground) Think of a pixel as three flashlights shining in your eyes: one red, one green, and one blue. If the lights are off (0,0,0), the color is black. If the lights are all on full-strength (255,255,255), the color is white.
